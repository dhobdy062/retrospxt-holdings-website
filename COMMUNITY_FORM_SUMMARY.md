### To receive real emails:

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add your email settings to `.env`:**
   ```env
   # For Gmail (recommended)
   GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
   NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=don@dhobdyjr.com
   ```

3. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
