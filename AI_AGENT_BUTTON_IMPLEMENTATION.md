# AI Agent Active Button Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented VAPI voice AI integration using the existing "AI Agent Active" button in the hero section of the Retrospxt Holdings website.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Button Integration
- **Location**: Hero section of the main website
- **Element**: Existing "AI Agent Active" floating card button
- **Functionality**: Click to start/end voice conversation with AI assistant

### 2. Visual States
The button now has multiple visual states:
- **Ready**: Green indicator, ready to start conversation
- **Connecting**: Yellow indicator with pulse animation
- **Connected**: Green indicator with pulse animation
- **Listening**: Blue indicator with pulse animation
- **Processing**: Purple indicator with pulse animation
- **Error**: Red indicator for error states
- **Disconnected**: Gray indicator when call ends

### 3. Voice Transcript
- **Floating Modal**: Appears during active calls
- **Real-time Display**: Shows conversation between user and AI assistant
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Close Button**: Users can minimize the transcript while keeping the call active

### 4. VAPI Integration Features
- **Real VAPI Support**: When properly configured with API keys
- **Mock Mode**: Demonstration mode when VAPI SDK is unavailable
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation if services are unavailable
- **Event Handling**: Proper call state management and error handling

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Integration Files
1. **`js/modules/vapi-integration.js`** - Main VAPI integration class
2. **`css/vapi-styles.css`** - Styling for button states and transcript
3. **`js/vapi-mock.js`** - Mock VAPI SDK for demonstration
4. **`index.html`** - Updated to include VAPI scripts and configuration

### Supporting Files
1. **`test-vapi.html`** - Test page for verifying integration
2. **`AI_AGENT_BUTTON_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This documentation

## How It Works

### Button Click Flow
1. User clicks the "AI Agent Active" button
2. Button state changes to "Connecting..."
3. VAPI initializes voice call (or mock simulation)
4. Transcript modal appears
5. AI assistant greets the user
6. Real-time conversation begins
7. User can end call by clicking button again

### Technical Architecture
```
User Click → VapiIntegration Class → VAPI SDK/Mock → Voice Call
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Button State → Event Handlers → Call Management → Transcript Display
```

## Configuration

### For Demo Mode (Current)
```javascript
window.VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY = 'demo-mode-key';
```

### For Production
1. Get VAPI API keys from [vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai)
2. Update the public key in `index.html`:
```javascript
window.VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your-actual-vapi-public-key';
```
3. Configure the VAPI server with your private key in `.env`
